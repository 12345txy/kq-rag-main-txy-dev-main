# KQ RAG

矿权RAG项目demo。

We prefer general-purpose RAG lib in [lab-1806-rag](https://github.com/pku-lab-1806-llm/lab-1806-rag) instead of this project.

## Development

Install Python 3.10 and uv at first.

See <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#getting-started> for more information.

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

See <https://pypi.org/project/lab-1806-vec-db/> for our vec-db library.

Run `kq_rag.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.

See `original` tag for the original code of the project and the tutorial in Chinese as a PDF file.
